                <h2>Work Philosophy</h2>
                <p>I have a wide variety of skills. My most useful and unique work related one is the ability to identify areas in an office's workflow that have significant room for increased efficiency. A lot of these improvements come from changes to computer based operations. Implementing simple AI to automate repetitive tasks for example. I also possess the skills to implement my own solutions. I work well with teams especially in a position of leadership. I am a team player. </p>

                <h2>Skills and Projects</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Functional knowledge of several programming languages including: HTML, CSS, Python, C#, and Javascript.</li>
                    <li>Passed CompTIA A+ 901 Exam on July 10, 2018. Currently studying to pass A+ 902 exam.</li>
                    <li>Wrote several Revit(Architectural modelling software) macros in C# language. Demo video included. <em>*Full-screen recommended*</em> Alternate link to video on Youtube: <a href="https://youtu.be/VXmS5e7EUpI">Macro Demo Video.</a> These macros automate several tasks that were previously done by hand at my former workplace. Specifically, they allow for creation of multiple sheets at once, number sheets according to an ordering convention unique to our projects, and allow them to be printed in this non-alphabetical order so that no rearranging of the sheets is needed after printing. None of these are doable with the built in Revit functionality.</li>
                    <li>Wrote another macro since making the video. It takes a user selected Excel file with Sheet Numbers and Sheet Names and creates sheets from those values. At Ciardullo Architecture we received large lists of
					specific sheet names and numbers that our clients/contractors request for a drawing set. This macro saves the time of inputting several hundred sheet names and numbers one by one by hand.</li>
					<li>Designed and built this webpage/resume in HTML/CSS.</li>
                    <li>My father has been a money manager for the majority of my life and currently runs a mutual fund. As such I have developed a solid understanding of world markets and general finanancial principles from time spent with him. </li>
