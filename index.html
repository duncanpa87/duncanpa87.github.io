                <h2>Work Philosophy</h2>
                <p>My attitude towards work is to do what I must accomplish my goal at hand while looking for ways to speed up the process. At my current position I do 95% of my work on a computer so I try to automate as much as I can. I enjoy finding solutions to problems and continually trying to improve upon those solutions. I am always looking to learn. A strong quality of mine is a willingness to approach a problem in several different ways, as opposed to beating one's head against a wall. I think that many businesses have a lot of room for improvement when it comes to increasing the efficiency of their day to day computer-based operations. I'd like to help them.

                <ul>
                    <li>Proficient in Autodesk Revit</li>
                    <li>Functional knowledge of several programming languages including: HTML, CSS, Python, C#.</li>
                    <li>Firm grasp of fundamental binary(computer) logic. Basic understanding of computer and electrical systems.</li>
                    <li>Wrote several Revit macros in C# language. Demo video included. <em>*Full-screen recommended*</em> These macros automate several tasks that were previously done by hand at this office. Specifically, they allow for creation of multiple sheets at once, number sheets according to an ordering convention unique to our projects, and allow them to be printed in this non-alphabetical order so that no rearrangement of the sheets is needed after printing. None of these are doable with the built in Revit functionality.</li>
                    <li>Skilled at drawing details in Revit. Can replicate hand-drawn or outside details efficiently and accurately.</li>
					<li>Designed and built this webpage/resume in HTML/CSS.</li>

            <div class="interests"><h2>Interests</h2><p> I play golf fairly regularly. It is generally a humbling experience. I enjoy working on computers and also playing video games. Currently I play a modest amount of Halo 5 on Xbox One and I also generally open the Pokemon Go app on my phone at least once a day when I am out and about. I'm almost always up for throwing a baseball, football, or playing any racquet sport imaginable. I occasionally strum a few chords on the guitar.</p>
			<p>I like to cook, especially with my wife. She is a great and thoughtful cook. I watch plenty of TV especially the majors of golf and playoff baseball. And of course Game of Thrones. </p>
