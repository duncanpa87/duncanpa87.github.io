                <h2>Work Philosophy</h2>
                <p>My attitude towards work is to do what I must accomplish my goal at hand while looking for ways to speed up the process. At my current position I do 95% of my work on a computer so I try to automate as much as I can. I enjoy finding solutions to problems and continually trying to improve upon those solutions. I am always looking to learn. A strong quality of mine is a willingness to approach a problem in several different ways, as opposed to beating one's head against a wall. I think that many businesses have a lot of room for improvement when it comes to increasing the efficiency of their day to day computer-based operations. I'd like to help them.

                <h2>Skills and Projects</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proficient in Autodesk Revit and Autocad with more emphasis on Revit.</li>
                    <li>Functional knowledge of several programming languages including: HTML, CSS, Python, C#.</li>
                    <li>Firm grasp of fundamental binary(computer) logic. Basic understanding of computer and electrical systems.</li>
                    <li>Wrote several Revit macros in C# language. Demo video included. <em>*Full-screen recommended*</em> Alternate link to video on Youtube: <a href="https://youtu.be/VXmS5e7EUpI">Macro Demo Video.</a> These macros automate several tasks that were previously done by hand at this office. Specifically, they allow for creation of multiple sheets at once, number sheets according to an ordering convention unique to our projects, and allow them to be printed in this non-alphabetical order so that no rearrangement of the sheets is needed after printing. None of these are doable with the built in Revit functionality.</li>
                    <li>Wrote another macro since making the video. It takes a user selected Excel file with Sheet Numbers and Sheet Names and creates sheets from those values. Our office receives large lists of 
					specific sheet names and numbers that our clients/contractors request for a drawing set. This macro saves the time of inputting several hundred sheet names and numbers one by one by hand.</li>
					<li>Skilled at drawing details in Revit. Can replicate hand-drawn or outside details efficiently and accurately.</li>
					<li>Designed and built this webpage/resume in HTML/CSS.</li>

            <div class="interests"><h2>Interests</h2><p> I play golf at least once a week when the weather permits. I like the pursuit of improvement at the game. It is challenging but also rewarding. I enjoy working and playing on computers. I own a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> that is a great educational computing and programming tool for me. My uncle is currently getting started on an automated CNC painting machine that will replicate photos as real paintings. I am involved in that. We will be using a Raspberry Pi to drive the motors of the machine. I currently play a modest amount of Halo 5 on Xbox One. I'm almost always up for throwing a baseball, football, or playing any racquet sport imaginable. I play some guitar too. </p>
			<p>I like to cook, especially with my wife. She is a great and thoughtful cook. I watch plenty of TV especially the majors of golf and playoff baseball. I also watch several different TV series including, of course, Game of Thrones. </p>
